# Change Log

## Version 2.2.10 (UCHIHAHA103 fork)

> **CLI 扩展 + 单实例窗口 + 最小化到系统托盘**

### New Features

- **`--output-dir <path>`** — 输出文件写入任意指定目录（自动创建），不再受 `OutputFileNameTemplate` 约束，无需先输出到默认目录再移动。
- **`--wait`** — 阻塞进程直到所有转码任务完成；exit code `0` = 全部成功，`1` = 有任意失败。适合脚本/自动化调用。
- **`--progress`** — 实时把转码进度以 `key=value` 协议写入 stdout（镜像 ffmpeg `-progress pipe:1` 格式），包含 `out_time`、`speed`、`progress=end`、`exit_code`、`out_file` 等字段，方便 AI/脚本解析进度条。
- **`--list-presets [--output-format json|text]`** — 枚举所有可用预设后退出；`json` 格式可被脚本直接 `ConvertFrom-Json` 消费。
- **`--probe [--output-format json|text] <files>`** — 输出媒体文件的时长、分辨率、编码、码率、大小等信息后退出；`json` 格式适合预估转码时间和输出大小。
- **单实例窗口**（Single-Instance）— 多次右键转换文件时，新任务追加到已有窗口的转换队列，不再弹出多个窗口。底层通过命名管道 IPC + 命名 Mutex 实现。
- **"最小化到系统托盘"按钮** — 标题栏右上角（最小化按钮左侧）新增托盘按钮；点击后窗口隐藏、系统托盘图标出现；单击托盘图标恢复窗口，托盘消失。

### Internal / Infrastructure

- `MediaProber.cs` — 利用工具自带 ffprobe 解析媒体信息，供 `--probe` 和 AI skill 进度预估使用。
- `ProgressWriter.cs` — 统一的 stdout 进度协议写入器，供 `--progress` 模式使用。
- `SingleInstanceManager.cs` — 单实例 IPC 管理器（命名管道 + Mutex）。
- `Debug.SilentConsoleMode` — CLI 输出模式下禁止调试日志污染 stdout（`--probe`/`--list-presets`/`--progress` 自动启用）。
- `ConversionJob.OutputDirectoryOverride` — 支持 `--output-dir` 的 job 级输出路径覆盖。



## Version 2.2.7 (UCHIHAHA103 fork hotfix)

> **修复 v2.2.3+ 安装后右键菜单丢失的根因**

经过完整的 9-stage bisect 定位，元凶是 **Stage 1（commit `33340d0`）** 在 `Settings.default.xml`
里新增的 preset **`Images to Video/To Mp4 (24fps)`**（原 issue #25）。该 preset 声明
`OutputType="Mp4"` 但 `InputTypes` 全部是 image 类别（png/jpg/bmp 等）。

完整失败链：
1. MSI deferred CA 运行 `FileConverter.exe --post-install-init`
2. 主程序加载 `Settings.default.xml` → `Settings` 类
3. `ConversionPreset.OnDeserializationComplete` → `CoerceInputTypes()` 发现 Mp4 输出不兼容
   Image 输入，**把该 preset 的所有 InputTypes 全部删除**（合约要求之一：输出类型必须和输入
   类别兼容，`Helpers.IsOutputTypeCompatibleWithCategory`）
4. `Save()` 把"清理后"的 Settings 写到 `%LocalAppData%\FileConverter\Settings.user.xml`。该
   preset 的 `InputTypes` 列表空了，序列化后 **完全没有 `<InputTypes>` 元素**
5. explorer 加载 shell extension，`FileConverterExtension` 读 `Settings.user.xml`。对应的
   `PresetReference.InputTypes` 反序列化为 **null**
6. `CanShowMenu()` 里 `presetReference.InputTypes.Contains(extension)` → **NullReferenceException**
7. SharpShell / COM 捕获异常，shell ext 被认为不可用 → **整个 File Converter 菜单都不出现**

### Fixes in v2.2.7

- **`FileConverterExtension.CanShowMenu` / `RefreshPresetList` 添加 null-guard**
  防止任何 preset 的 `InputTypes == null` 时崩溃（保底，防止今后同类问题）。
- **从 `Settings.default.xml` 中移除 `Images to Video/To Mp4 (24fps)` preset**
  这个 preset 本身与现有 preset 机制不兼容（Image → Video 需要特殊的 category 支持）。
  `To Webp (lossless)` preset 保留，不受影响。
- **保留 v2.2.6 的所有修复**（v2.2.4 shell ext 注册提前、v2.2.5 CA Return="ignore"、
  v2.2.6 `Environment.Exit(0)` 清理 MSI 日志）。



## Version 2.2.6 (UCHIHAHA103 fork hotfix)

> **后续清理：修掉 v2.2.5 安装日志里的 CLR 未处理异常（功能无影响，但清理日志）**

- **Fixes: `FileConverter.exe --register-shell-extension` exits with CLR
  exit code `0xE0434352` (-532462766) after doing its job correctly**.
  After `RegAsm.Register64` successfully writes HKCR, `HandleEarlyCommandLineArgs`
  called `Application.Current.Shutdown()`, which then ran WPF's `OnExit`.
  `OnExit` unconditionally does `Ioc.Default.GetRequiredService<IUpgradeService>()`,
  which throws `InvalidOperationException` because no services were ever
  registered in the early CLI path. The unhandled exception surfaced as the
  confusing CLR error code above in MSI verbose logs.
  Fix: use `Environment.Exit(0)` to terminate the process directly, bypassing
  WPF's shutdown / `OnExit` pipeline entirely. The MSI log now shows
  `InstallShell.Return value 1.` with no "actual error code" line.
- No installer / shell-registration behavior changes vs v2.2.5 — this release
  is purely a log-cleanliness / correctness fix.

## Version 2.2.5 (UCHIHAHA103 fork hotfix)

> **修复 v2.2.4 安装时出现 "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package"（错误 1722）**

- **Fixes: Installer aborts with MSI error 1722 at "Register shell extension to Windows Explorer"**.
  v2.2.4 restored `Return="check"` on the `InstallShell` deferred custom
  action (matching v2.2.2 behavior). On machines with stale MSI cache or
  other environment quirks, the SYSTEM-context `RegAsm.Register64` call
  can still fail — and because `Return="check"` escalates any CA failure
  into a fatal installer error, the user sees the classic
  "A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected" dialog
  and the installation rolls back.
  Fix:
  - `InstallShell` / `UninstallShell` / `PostInstallInit` now use
    `Return="ignore"` so a single CA failure can never abort the install.
  - `PostInstallShellFallback` (immediate mode, runs in the elevated
    installer process AFTER `InstallFinalize`) now runs on **both** fresh
    install and upgrade. It has no `SYSTEM` / no WPF-HKCU quirks and no
    `FileRef` 2753 exposure, and acts as the reliable primary path.
  - As long as **either** attempt succeeds, Explorer shows the right-click
    menu. If both somehow fail the install still completes; the user can
    then run `FileConverter.exe --register-shell-extension FileConverterExtension.dll`
    manually from an admin prompt.

## Version 2.2.4 (UCHIHAHA103 fork hotfix)

> **修复 v2.2.3 安装后右键菜单消失的严重回归问题**（两个独立根因）

- **Fixes: Context menu missing after install/upgrade to v2.2.3 (critical regression)**.
  Two independent bugs both broke shell extension registration in v2.2.3:
  1. `OnStartup` called `ApplySystemTheme()` before handling non-UI command-line
     args. The MSI deferred CA `--register-shell-extension` runs as `SYSTEM`,
     which has no HKCU and cannot safely mutate the WPF `ResourceDictionary`
     that `ApplySystemTheme` touches. This corrupted WPF app state and caused
     the subsequent `RegAsm.Register64` call to silently fail.
     Fix: added `HandleEarlyCommandLineArgs()` that runs **before any WPF / DI
     initialization** and handles `register-shell-extension`,
     `unregister-shell-extension`, `remove-user-data`, `version` synchronously
     and shuts the app down immediately. Restores v2.2.2 behavior.
  2. `Product.wxs` `InstallShell` custom action was gated by `NOT Installed`,
     which evaluates to **false** during a v2.2.2 → v2.2.3 major-upgrade because
     MSI sets `Installed=true` for the existing product. `InstallShell`,
     `PostInstallInit` and `PostInstallShellFallback` were all skipped, so
     upgrading users ended up with no shell registration at all.
     Fix: changed condition to `NOT (REMOVE~="ALL")`, which correctly fires on
     both fresh install and upgrade/repair but not on uninstall.
- **Workaround for users stuck on v2.2.3**: open an admin PowerShell and run
  `cd "C:\Program Files\File Converter"; .\FileConverter.exe --register-shell-extension ".\FileConverterExtension.dll"`
  (no reinstall required).

## Version 2.2.1 (UCHIHAHA103 fork hotfix)

- Fixes: **Language setting has no effect** (upstream #593, #606, #609, #646, #667, #673, #690, #692, #735, #737, #750).
  Root cause: `GetSupportedCultures()` only probed the legacy `Languages\<culture>\` folder that
  depends on a fragile `robocopy` post-build step. When that step failed or the installer
  shipped without the folder, the Language ComboBox was empty (or save silently aborted),
  so no language - including 简体中文 (zh-CN) - could ever be applied.
  - Also probe the standard .NET satellite assembly path `<exe>\<culture>\FileConverter.resources.dll`.
  - Replace the `robocopy /MOVE` post-build step with a `copy` so both layouts coexist.
  - Guard `ApplicationLanguage` setter and the Settings `Save`/`Close` paths with try/catch
    + error dialog so a culture apply error no longer silently closes the Settings window.
- Fixes: **FFmpeg conversion hangs indefinitely (v2.2 regression)** (upstream #749, #740,
  #739, #716, #703, #700). Cherry-picked from upstream PR #732 (thanks to HapppppyMoon):
  remove `-progress pipe:1` and disable `RedirectStandardOutput`, which were filling the
  stdout pipe buffer and deadlocking the ffmpeg process.
- Tech: Add GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) that builds
  `FileConverter.sln` on every push and verifies that the zh-CN satellite assembly is
  deployed under at least one of the two supported layouts.
